## Meet minimal APIs

Minimal APIs are a low ceremony way to build small microservices and HTTP APIs in ASP.NET Core. Minimal APIs hook into ASP.NET Coreâ€™s hosting and routing capabilities and allow you to create fully functioning APIs with just a few lines of code.

```csharp
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World!");

app.Run();
```
We have created a series of quickstarts to get you familiar with minimal APIs.
